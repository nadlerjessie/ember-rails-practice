== README

This app was built to practice setting up an API in Rails and connecting it with Ember as the front end of the application. A small school domain is being used where a course has many teachers and a course has many students.

This portion serves as the backend API. Run the Rails App locally, as well as the Ember App located in flatiron-school-ember.

## Collaborators 

Amanda Johns, Natalie Coley, Tracy Lum, Madeline Ford
